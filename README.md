### _Hi there 👋, I'm JiangPeng._

​	I’m glad to meet you in the world of the internet. I started learning computer programming at the end of 2011. At that time, my account was hacked😪, so I accidentally learned about computer technology and became fascinated by computer science and code.☺️

​	Now I have started working as a Java developer. Besides work and study, I like reading, photography, traveling, writing books. I have an Alaskan dog, a British shorthair cat, a Tesla car. I hope to make friends with you and improve together! Work hard for a better future!

​	I have studied Spring, SpringCloud, Netty, Kafka, RocketMQ, Redis, MySQL and other technologies in depth. I have my own understanding of high concurrency, high availability and high performance. I am familiar with various solutions for distributed microservices. Next, I want to develop an open source project that can handle 100k QPS. I hope to succeed.
